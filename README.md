The mixsqp R package provides algorithms based on [sequential 
quadratic programming][sqp] for maximum likelihood estimation of the
mixture proportions in a finite mixture model where the component
densities are known. The SQP algorithm is expected to obtain solutions
that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK
interior-point solver (called via the "KWDual" function in the
[REBayes package][rebayes]), and is expected to compute these
solutions much more quickly in large data sets.

For more details on the methods, please see the [journal
paper][jcgs-paper] or the [arXiv preprint][arxiv-paper].

The methods were originally implemented in [Julia][julia];
please see [here][mixsqp-julia] for the Julia implementation.

If you find a bug, or you have a question or feedback on our work,
please post an [issue][issues].

## Quick Start

Install mixsqp from [CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/varbvs):

```R
install.packages("mixsqp")
```

For more detailed installation instructions, see the "Setup" section
below.

Once you have installed the package, load the package in R:

```R
library(mixsqp)
```

Next, run the small example provided with the mixsqp function:

```R
example("mixsqp")
```

For a more detailed illustration of the SQP algorithm applied to the
problem of computing maximum-likelihood estimates for a mixture model,
read through the [introductory vignette][mixsqp-vignette].

To learn more, visit the [package website][mixsqp-website], or view
the "mixsqp" help page:

```R
help("mixsqp")
```

## Setup

To install mixsqp from [CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/varbvs), in R
run:

```R
install.packages("mixsqp")
```

Alternatively, to install the latest version of the mixsqp package
from GitHub, use [devtools][devtools]:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("stephenslab/mixsqp",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

This command should automatically install all required packages if
they are not installed already.

If you have cloned the repository locally, you can install the package
with the `install_local` function from devtools. Assuming your working
directory contains the mixsqp repository, run this code to install the
package:

```R
library(devtools)
install_local("mixsqp")
```

### Additional setup notes

+ Compiling the mixsqp package from source will require a C++ compiler
setup that is appropriate for the the R installed on your
computer. For details, refer to the [CRAN documentation][cran]. For
Mac computers, see [these notes][compiling-macos].

+ To use the (optional) alternative solver, "mixkwdual", which is
mostly useful for comparisons of the different optimization methods,
you will need to install the [REBayes][rebayes] package. The REBayes
package, in turn, requires the [Rmosek][mosek] package. Refer to the
[MOSEK documentation][mosek-docs] for instructions on installing the
Rmosek package. Once you have followed these steps, you can run
[this example](inst/code/test.rmosek.R) to verify that Rmosek is
correctly installed. Installation of the REBayes package also allows
you to build [the vignette][mixsqp-vignette] and view it locally:

```R
devtools::install_github("stephenslab/mixsqp",build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(mixsqp)
vignette("mixsqp-intro")
```

## Developer notes

### Testing the package

To install and test the mixsqp R package, run the following commands
in the shell:

```bash
R CMD build mixsqp
R CMD INSTALL mixsqp_0.3-31.tar.gz
R CMD check --as-cran mixsqp_0.3-31.tar.gz
```

Note that these commands require that the dependencies have already
been installed. See the [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) file for details.

### Updating the C++ source and documentation

When any changes are made to [roxygen2][roxygen2] markup or to the C++
code in the `src` directory, simply run `devtools::document()` to 
update the [RcppExports.cpp](src/RcppExports.cpp), the NAMESPACE file,
and the package documentation files in the `man` directory.

### Updating the pkgdown site

Run this line of R code to build the website (make sure you have an
Internet connection while running the code):

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Version 1.4.1 of pkgdown was used.

### Other developer notes

Add file `pre-commit` to `.git/hooks` in the git repository to
prevent commits that don't include a change to the package version.
