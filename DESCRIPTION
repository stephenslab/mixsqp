Description: Provides optimization algorithms based on sequential
  quadratic programming (SQP) for maximum likelihood estimation of the
  mixture proportions in a finite mixture model where the component
  densities are known. The algorithms are expected to obtain solutions
  that are at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art MOSEK
  interior-point solver (called by function "KWDual" in the 'REBayes'
  package), and they are expected to arrive at solutions more quickly
  in large data sets. The algorithms are described in Y. Kim,
  P. Carbonetto, M. Stephens & M. Anitescu (2012) <arXiv:1806.01412>.
